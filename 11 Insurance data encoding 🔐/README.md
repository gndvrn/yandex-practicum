It was necessary to develop an algorithm for matrix encryption of object features in data. This algorithm will limit the circle of people in the company who have access to them.

For this purpose, we were provided with data on clients of one of the insurance companies.

### Brief summary of completed tasks

#### 1. Data overview
- Importing libraries;
- Reading the source data with error handling;
- Primary data analysis using a number of available statistical tools;
- Correction of minor data issues that were identified;

#### 2. Algorithm principle of operation
- Mathematical component of the algorithm's operation is described;
- The admissibility of using this algorithm to form accurate predictions at all stages is justified;

#### 3. Implementation of data encryption algorithm
- A Python class for encrypting and decrypting data based on a hash key has been written;

#### 4. Algorithm verification
- At all stages of data transformation, the quality of model predictions based on the <tt>R<sup>2</sup></tt> metric was evaluated. The algorithm works correctly and does not change existing dependencies in the data.

However, this algorithm cannot be called universal and providing a sufficient level of security for large volumes of data. For small data sets, the algorithm is convenient and easy to use, which meets the technical requirements of the company.
